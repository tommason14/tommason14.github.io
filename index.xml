      <title>Predicting Entropic Effects of Water Mixing with Ionic Liquids</title>

      <description>Study into the interactions of water with various hydrogen-bonding ionic liquids. We show that water incorporates itself into choline-based ionic liquids with minimal adverse effects on the neat ionic structure, resulting in a lower entropic penalty when compared to imidazolium-based ILs. Electronic properties were studied along with effects on IR spectra from a theoretical perspective.</description>

      <description>This talk looked at Liberty Mutual’s transformation to Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and DevOps. For a large, heavily regulated industry, this task can not only be daunting, but viewed by many as impossible. Often, organizations try to reduce the friction through micro-fixes, but Eddie’s team asked how to change the culture to reduce the friction and concluded with the following final points:
 Don’t mandate DevOps. Give employees the chance to master their discipline with examples to set and follow.</description>

      <description>This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.
No content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html
Setting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.
This implementation uses Fusejs, jquery and mark.js
Initial setup Search depends on additional output content type of JSON in config.toml
[outputs] home = [&amp;quot;HTML&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;JSON&amp;quot;]  Searching additional fileds To search additional fields defined in front matter, you must add it in 2 places.</description>
